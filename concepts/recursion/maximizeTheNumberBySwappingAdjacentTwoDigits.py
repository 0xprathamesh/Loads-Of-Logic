Three people are playing a game in which one persone is selected  first, the second person gives the 
selected person a number N, and the third person gives the selected person a number M. 
The selected person has to maximize the number given by the second person in a way that 
1 . She can maximize the number given by the second person only by swapping the adjacent two digits of the number.
2 . The number that the third person gives is the maximum number of swaps allowed.

Find the maximum number that the selected person can acheive.

Input 1 =  The number N
Input 2 = The number M


Input1 = 1234
Input2 =  2
Output = 3124
Here the number can be swapped as 1234 -> 1324 -> 3124

Input1 = 1123
Input2 =  1
Output = 1213
Here the number can be swapped as 1123 -> 1213
